# Surface-Go-2-OpenCore
macOS on the Core m3-8100Y Microsoft Surface Go 2 thanks to [Acidanthera's OpenCore bootloader](https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg).

## Disclaimer
This repository is neither a howto nor an installation manual. Using these files requires at least basic knowledge of [Acidanthera's OpenCore bootloader](https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg), ACPI, UEFI and the art of hackintoshing in general. I recommend reading the excellent [Dortania's OpenCore Install Guide](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide), as well as all its linked resources.

Although this repository is a fork of [kingo132's Surface Go 2 hackintosh repository](https://github.com/kingo132/surface-go2-hackintosh), my OpenCore EFI folder was built from scratch by following [Dortania's OpenCore Install Guide](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide) with the latest releases of [Acidanthera's OpenCore bootloader](https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg) and every required kexts. Nevertheless, [kingo132's repository](https://github.com/kingo132/surface-go2-hackintosh) provided an extremely valuable and helpful resource for building my OpenCore EFI folder and hacking the tablet's UEFI BIOS.

## Recommendations
I recommend completely erasing the device's SSD by creating a new GPT partition table before attempting to install macOS, as it makes the installation process much easier. You may use any Linux live ISO with a partitioning tool such as `GParted` or `KPartition` to erase the SSD.

For macOS to be able to boot on the Surface Go 2, the `Secure Boot` option needs to be _**disabled**_ in the BIOS. The boot screen will then display a large red bar with a lock icon at the top of the display when Secure Boot is disabled. This is normal.

Please be aware that all `PlatformInfo` and `SMBIOS` information was removed from the OpenCore `config.plist` files. Users will therefore need to generate their own `PlatformInfo` with [CorpNewt's GenSMBIOS tool](https://github.com/corpnewt/GenSMBIOS) before attempting to boot a Surface Go 2 with this repository's EFI folder.

The `kexts` required to enable the trackpad and the touchscreen are special versions of `VoodooI2C.kext` and `VoodooI2CHID.kext` [patched and improved by lazd](https://github.com/jlempen/Surface-Go-2-OpenCore/issues/1#issuecomment-1705597716). Updating those `kexts` with the official ones from [the VoodooI2C repo](https://github.com/VoodooI2C) will most certainly break trackpad and touchscreen functionality! They were renamed to `VoodooI2C-SurfaceTouch.kext` and `VoodooI2CHID-SurfaceTouch.kext` so as not to be auto-updated by tools such as [OCAT](https://github.com/ic005k/OCAuxiliaryTools).
The `AirportItlwm.kext` from the [OpenIntelWireless repo](https://github.com/OpenIntelWireless/itlwm) is required to enable the Wifi chip and was renamed to `AirportItlwm-Sonoma.kext` for the same reason.

## Turning off BD PROCHOT
On this device, BD PROCHOT will activate at temperatures as low as 60째C ~ 70째C. When it kicks in, the CPU will throttle down to 0.4Ghz, making the device more or less unusable. That's why BD PROCHOT needs to be disabled in order to increase the performance of the machine.

You may use [arter97's DisablePROCHOT UEFI extension](https://github.com/arter97/DisablePROCHOT) which is already included in the EFI/OC/Drivers folder to disable BD PROCHOT. However, if the CPU continues to be fully loaded with BD PROCHOT disabled, the temperature may increase up to 90째C. Beyond 90째C, the device will become unstable and either crash or power off. To avoid this, the temperature needs to be kept under control.

The DisablePROCHOT.efi driver is included but disabled in both config.plist files, as enabling it leads to the CPU overheating and the computer shutting down during install. You may enable the driver once macOS is installed on the device.

## Undervolting to reduce heat and improve performance
There are two undervolting tools available for macOS:
* [Volta](https://volta.garymathews.com)
* [VoltageShift](https://github.com/sicreative/VoltageShift)

The `VoltageShift.kext` is already included and enabled in this repository's `Kexts` folder. To be able to launch the `voltageshift` command line tool from anywhere, copy [VoltageShift from the Tools folder](https://github.com/jlempen/Surface-Go-2-OpenCore/blob/main/Tools/VoltageShift-EFI.zip) to your `/usr/local/bin` folder by entering `sudo cp voltageshift /usr/local/bin/` in the macOS terminal after navigating to the folder where you downloaded and unzipped the `voltageshift` executable file.

Please refer to the instructions found in the [VoltageShift repository](https://github.com/sicreative/VoltageShift), as well as to the excellent howto found in [zearp's repository](https://github.com/zearp/Nucintosh#undervolting).

## Disabling CFG Lock

1. Boot into OpenCore
2. Press Space to see the list of tools
3. Select `setup_var`
4. Press enter
5. Restart

To verify this worked, press Space and select the `ControlMsrE2` -- if it was successful, you'll see:

> This firmware has UNLOCKED MSR 0xE2 register!

Finally, edit `config.plist` and set `Kernel -> Quirks -> AppleCpuPmCfgLock` and `Kernel -> Quirks -> AppleXcpmCfgLock` to false.

## Enabling native HiDPI display settings in macOS
On the installed macOS system, the default display resolution is too small for a small device such as the Surface Go 2. To enable the native HiDPI settings in the Display Preferences of macOS, download and run the [one-key-hidpi](https://github.com/jlempen/one-key-hidpi) script and select the option `(4) 1920x1280 Display`. This fork of [xzhih's one-key-hidpi tool](https://github.com/xzhih/one-key-hidpi) was modified to add the 1920x1280 resolution needed for the Surface Go 2.

## Disabling Sleep and enabling Hibernate
As there is still no solution to the sleep issue on the Surface Go 2, it is recommended to disable Sleep altogether and use Hibernate for now:
```
sudo pmset restoredefaults;
sudo pmset -a hibernatemode 25;
```

## Fixing broken iMessage
To fix issues with iMessage (Apple Messages) related to the [Intel Wireless driver](https://github.com/OpenIntelWireless/itlwm), please disable the `AirportItlwm-Sonoma.kext` in your `config.plist` and use the [itlwm_v2.2.0_stable.kext.zip](https://github.com/OpenIntelWireless/itlwm/releases/download/v2.2.0/itlwm_v2.2.0_stable.kext.zip) and its companion app [HeliPort](https://github.com/OpenIntelWireless/HeliPort/releases/download/v1.4.1/HeliPort.dmg) instead.
